# 🏠 PropWise-AI  
## Intelligent Property Price Prediction System

PropWise-AI is a machine learning–based real estate analytics application that predicts residential property prices using structured housing data. The system uses a complete Scikit-learn pipeline with feature engineering and Random Forest regression, deployed via an interactive Streamlit web interface.

This project was developed as part of an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning course (Milestone 1).

## 📌 Objective

Estimating property prices accurately is challenging due to multiple influencing factors such as area, rooms, amenities, and furnishing status.

The goal of this project is to:

- Predict property prices using classical machine learning  
- Evaluate model performance  
- Identify key price-driving factors  
- Provide a user-friendly web interface
